## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Beginner User Interaction:
```
User: "Can you show me a plot of the temperature data?"
AI: "I'll create a visualization to help you understand this data better. 
     Let me show you a histogram of temperature readings that displays 
     how often different temperature values occur in your sensor data.
     
     💡 **Next steps you might find helpful:**
     1. Compare temperature patterns between OK and KO samples
     2. Analyze temperature correlation with other sensors
     3. Create a heatmap of temperature patterns
     
     📊 **What this histogram shows:** The chart displays how often 
     different sensor values occur. It helps you understand the typical 
     ranges and identify unusual patterns in your data."
```

### Expert User Interaction:
```
User: "Show me the statistical significance of the correlation between pressure and humidity sensors"
AI: "The analysis reveals several significant patterns and statistical 
     relationships. I'll create a comprehensive visualization with 
     detailed statistical insights showing the correlation between 
     pressure and humidity sensors.
     
     🎯 **Advanced analysis opportunities:**
     • Consider running additional statistical tests like ANOVA for 
       multi-class comparisons
     • Effect sizes can help quantify practical significance beyond 
       statistical significance
     
     🔬 **Advanced Analysis:** Consider running additional statistical 
     tests like ANOVA for multi-class comparisons, or non-parametric 
     tests if data assumptions aren't met. The effect sizes can help 
     quantify practical significance beyond statistical significance."
